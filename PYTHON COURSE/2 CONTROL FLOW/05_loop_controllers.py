# The break Statement
# With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

# The continue Statement
# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

# The pass Statement
# for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass

# having an empty for loop like this, would raise an error without the pass statement
